# Data-* Observatory

Data* Observatory tries to visually map the latest concepts and software that might be interesting to data people: data engineers, data scientists, and data analysts.

Each of these concepts or pieces of software is represented in the night sky viewport by a planet. Clicking on a viewport planet opens up a short tl;dr introduction to its topic and links for learning more. 
Planets are layout in regions by similarity so that one could quickly explore a topic of interest.
